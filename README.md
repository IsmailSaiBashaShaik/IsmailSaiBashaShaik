- ⚡ Fun fact: The term "full stack developer" refers to someone who has expertise in both front-end and back-end development. This includes mastering technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the client-side (front-end) and languages like Python, Ruby, or Node.js for the server-side (back-end). Full stack developers are often compared to "unicorns" in the tech world for their ability to work across the entire web development spectrum.
